    <h2>This Authentic New Orleans Gumbo is made with a dark roux, vegetables, chicken, sausage, and shrimp, and served over rice. This is a beloved recipe shared with me by a native New Orleanian.</h2>
    
    
    <p>As you probably have gathered, I love making comfort food style recipes that use lots of fresh produce and real ingredients. This gumbo is no exception.</p>
    
    <h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
    
    <h3><b>For the Roux</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 heaping cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup oil (vegetable or canola oil)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Gumbo</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bunch celery , diced, leaves and all</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper , diced</li>
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper , diced</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onion , finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh parsley leaves , finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1-2 Tablespoons cajun seasoning *</li>
        <li>6-8 cups Chicken broth *</li>
        <li>12 ounce package andouille sausages , sliced into 'coins' (substitute Polska Kielbasa if you can't find a good Andouille)</li>
        <li>Meat from 1 Rotisserie Chicken*</li>
        <li>2 cups Shrimps , pre cooked</li>
        <li>cooked white rice for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><b>Steps</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Make the Roux*: In a large, heavy bottom stock pot combine flour and oil. Cook on medium-low heat, stirring constantly for 30-45 minutes. This part takes patience--when it's finished it should be as dark as chocolate and have a soft, "cookie dough" like consistency. Be careful not to let it burn! Feel free to add a little more flour or oil as needed to reach this consistency.</p></li>
        <li><p>Brown the sausage. In a separate skillet on medium-high heat place the sausage slices in one layer in the pan. Brown them well on one side (2-3 minutes) and then use a fork to flip each over onto the other side to brown. Remove to a plate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook the vegetables in broth. Add ½ cup of the chicken broth to the hot skillet that had the sausage to deglaze the pan. Pour the broth and drippings into your large soup pot. </p></li>
        <li><p>Add remaining 5 ½ cups of chicken broth. Add veggies, parsley, and roux to the pot and stir well. </p></li>
        <li><p>Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly tender. (Skim off any foam that may rise to the top of the pot.) Stir in cajun seasoning, to taste.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add meat. Add chicken, sausage, and shrimp.</p></li>
        <li><p>Taste and serve. At this point taste it and add more seasonings to your liking--salt, pepper, chicken bullion paste, garlic, more Joe's stuff or more chicken broth--until you reach the perfect flavor. Serve warm over rice. (Tastes even better the next day!)</p></li>
